# Age Calculator

This is a simple Age Calculator web app built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Luxon library to calculate the exact age in years, months, and days based on the user's birthdate.

## Features

- Custom JavaScript datepicker (not the default HTML date input)
- Calculates age using Luxon for accurate date/time manipulation
- Validates input to ensure the birthdate is valid and not in the future
- Displays the age result on the same page after submission
- Simple and responsive styling for a clean user experience

## How to Use

1. Click on the input field or calendar icon to open the datepicker.
2. Select your birthdate from the calendar.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. Your exact age in years, months, and days will be displayed below the button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) for date/time calculations

## Notes

- The datepicker prevents selecting future dates.
- The input field is read-only to enforce using the datepicker for consistent date format.
